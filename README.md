# Description
  - This automated scheduling program is designed to arrange work schedules for waitstaff ‍ and bartenders  of a restaurant with approximately 14 employees.
    
  - The program utilizes the availability information of each employee based on their non-working days.  It features a scheduling method that utilizes this information to create randomized yet efficient work schedules for the staff.
  
  - The program also incorporates a Doubly Linked List data structure  to efficiently manage individual employee information within an employee list. ️ Here, I use the Quick Sort algorithm ⚡ to prioritize the scheduling of employees, who work few hours in the month. ⏱️
