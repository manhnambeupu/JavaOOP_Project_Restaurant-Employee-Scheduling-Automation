"This is an automated scheduling program designed to arrange work schedules for waitstaff and bartenders of a restaurant with approximately 14 employees. The program utilizes the availability information of each employee based on their non-working days. It features a scheduling method that utilizes this information to create randomized work schedules for the staff. The program also incorporates a Doubly Linked List data structure to efficiently manage individual employee information within an employee list."
