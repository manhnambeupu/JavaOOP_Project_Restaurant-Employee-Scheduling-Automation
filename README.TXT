## Description

<div style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px 20px;">
  This is an automated scheduling program designed to arrange work schedules for waitstaff and bartenders of a restaurant with approximately 14 employees. The program utilizes the availability information of each employee based on their non-working days. It features a scheduling method that utilizes this information to create **randomized** work schedules for the staff.  

  The program also incorporates a Doubly Linked List data structure to efficiently manage individual employee information within an employee list. Here, I use the Quick Sort algorithm to **prioritize** the scheduling of employees who work few hours in the month.
